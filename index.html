               <h3>Birth of SaffronStays</h3>
               <span>Our fondest memory of vacationing with our family is travelling through Europe with our toddlers in tow: having the freedom to experience stunning locations in quaint homestays, no one judging us for cooking khichdi for our two raucous children while we gorged on local delicacies ourselves, and always being showered with impeccable hospitality in every home. We were the quintessential Indian families exploring the world, wanting the certainty of safety and quality, and the privacy to enjoy our holiday on our own terms. This holiday changed our lives forever. It gave birth to SaffronStays. <br> <br> 

                Rank outsiders to the hospitality industry, we decided to address the dearth of curated experiences back home. We unlocked the gates of otherwise inaccessible private vacation homes to families looking for holidays that extended beyond checklists of must-sees and must-dos. Today we service the needs of both, Home Owners and Guests. Owners who have gorgeous homes that need to be maintained and, guests who are looking for the reliability of hotel services in the luxury of a private serviced home; often a short getaway that fits into a busy schedule. We have, and always will provide unforgettable private spaces for friends, families and colleagues to bond and create memories in. We discover and unlock only the best private homes so that guests may never tire from decision fatigue and yet can take short getaways despite their busy schedules.</span>
